# myLazyVim
my config using the LazyVim setup by @folke. Folke has contributed many great things to the community with his plugins and Neovim code contributions. This simple starter config is a thing of beauty! 

To get started, clone the [starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) to ~/.config/nvim and when you start `nvim`, LazyVim will get to work and download all the plugins required behind the scenes. Have a look at `example.lua` for examples of how to add extra plugins, disable/enabled LazyVim plugins, and override and extend the configuration of LazyVim plugins.
