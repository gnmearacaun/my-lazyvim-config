# ðŸ’¤ myLazyVim

My configurations using [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) crafted by @folke. Folke has contributed many great things to the community with his plugins and Neovim code contributions. This sleek template for is a thing of beauty! 

Clone the [starter](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) to ~/.config/nvim and when you start `nvim`, LazyVim will get to work and download all the plugins required behind the scenes. Have a look at `example.lua` for examples of how to add extra plugins, disable/enabled LazyVim plugins, and override and extend the configuration of LazyVim plugins.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for details.

Includes vimwiki, autoscroll and a few of my favorite keybindings. Saves extra work!
